        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It does not take a lot of ingredients (or a lot of money) to make a classic Bolognese recipe. What it does take, though, is patience for the sauce to achieve the ideal authentic texture. You are going to go low and slowâ€”it will take around 3 hours, but most of that cook time is hands-off.</p>
